Design an efficient system - which consumes a stream of trading messages, parse the messages and publish the parsed messages for the consumers


upstream System -> layer of servers -> downstream System


Performant
Scalable
As these are trading messages, sequence is important



Code, price, date

code - date
EMC2


{
    Symbol
	MsgType - Sell/Buy
	Date
	Quantity
}



Servers will be polling one message - processing it - publishing it to downstream


DB
Symbol, Quantity


server 1 polls 1 message
parses the message and read the symbol, lock the DB entry for the symbol, update the entry in DB,  publish the updated message
